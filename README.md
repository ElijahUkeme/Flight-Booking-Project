# Flight-Booking-Project
A Spring boot project for flight booking management system. 
The database used is MYSQL
The user will create an Account with the App before being able to use it
The list of all the route that the company flews as well as the prices for both Economy and Business class is shown for the customer to view
I am using the RESTFUL API of this project for a flutter mobile App
There is also a provision for the passengers traveled to book a hotel around the destination airport incase they arrived late
Json Web Token(JWT) is used for security
